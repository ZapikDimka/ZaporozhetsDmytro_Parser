Zaporozhets JSON Parser

Description

This project implements a parser designed to read and process JSON data structures, providing a structured representation of parsed content for further analysis and use.

Technical Description

The parser processes input JSON data according to predefined grammar rules created using the Pest library. It extracts JSON elements such as objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, and null values, and outputs the parsed data in a structured format.

Applications

The Zaporozhets JSON Parser can be applied in various scenarios, including:

Data Analysis: Parsing and structuring data from JSON files for analysis and reporting.

Configuration Management: Reading configuration files in JSON format for software applications.

Educational Purposes: Demonstrating parsing techniques and grammar rule implementation in Rust.

Development Tools: Integrating the parser into development pipelines for JSON data validation and processing.
